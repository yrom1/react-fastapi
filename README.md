# react-fastapi

React dashboard site with a fastapi backend!

# notes
I used `npx create-react-app front` to create the react app. Because React Router was such a pain and breaks the API so often I'm doing everything in pure React following `https://ncoughlin.com/posts/react-navigation-without-react-router/`. Theme stuff from https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-add-dark-mode-to-a-react-application/.
