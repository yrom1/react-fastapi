Because React Router was such a pain and breaks the API so often I'm doing everything in pure React following `https://ncoughlin.com/posts/react-navigation-without-react-router/`. Theme stuff from https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-add-dark-mode-to-a-react-application/.

Something I've been thinking about. You see how this is one page: https://tobymao.com/? That's kinda nice actually. If you think of the site as a resume, I have one pageâ€“who am I to have three pages? People aren't going to click through my site anyway, probably. If they click on the site then I can go full tilt and put all my cool stuff on that single home page, rather than spread stuff across pages.
