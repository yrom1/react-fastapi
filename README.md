React dashboard site with a fastapi backend!

Because React Router was such a pain and breaks the API so often I'm doing everything in pure React following https://ncoughlin.com/posts/react-navigation-without-react-router/. Theme stuff from https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-add-dark-mode-to-a-react-application/.

Something I've been thinking about. You see how this is one page: https://tobymao.com/? That's kinda nice actually. If you think of the site as a resume, I have one pageâ€“who am I to have three pages? People aren't going to click through my site anyway, probably. If they click on the site then I can go full tilt and put all my cool stuff on that single home page, rather than spread stuff across pages.

It's live, just felt like doing it. It's on EC2 with an elastic ip that I set up like this on google domains: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32467541/link-a-google-domain-to-amazon-ec2-server. Here's how I used nginx to listen on port 80 to redirect to port 3000 react:

I only had to change the server_name and proxy_pass. None of the backend is set up yet.
